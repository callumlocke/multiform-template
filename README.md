# Multiform template

This repo is an example of a [Multiform](https://github.com/callumlocke/multiform) module.

Branches:

- [`master`](https://github.com/callumlocke/multiform-template) – just the basics
- `tdd` (current) – an example with linting and testing


## TDD setup

- Both module code and tests are in `src`, so both get built together.
- To keep it simple, no testing library (mocha, tape etc) is used for this demo. The test script is just `node test.js`.
- Run `npm run watch` to automatically rebuild and run tests while you work on files in `src`.
